# Hunt Sensor Module

#### Project Overview

The Hunt Sensor Module project demonstrates how to use a digital Hall Effect sensor with an Arduino Mega to detect the presence of a magnetic field. The Hall Effect sensor provides a digital output, which changes state when exposed to a magnetic field. This project reads the sensor state and prints the result to the Serial Monitor, indicating whether a magnetic field is detected or not.

#### Components Needed

1. **Arduino Mega**
2. **Hall Effect Sensor Module**
3. **Jumper Wires**

#### Block Diagram


#### Circuit Setup

1. **Connect the Hall Effect Sensor to Arduino Mega:**
   - **Signal Pin** of the Hall Effect sensor to digital pin 2 (huntSensorPin) on Arduino Mega
   - **VCC** of the Hall Effect sensor to **5V** on Arduino Mega
   - **GND** of the Hall Effect sensor to **GND** on Arduino Mega

#### Instructions

1. **Circuit Setup:**
   - Connect the Hall Effect sensor module to the Arduino Mega as described in the circuit setup section.

2. **Code Upload:**
   - Open the Arduino IDE and create a new sketch.
   - Copy and paste the provided Arduino code into the sketch.

3. **Testing:**
   - Upload the code to the Arduino Mega.
   - Open the serial monitor in Arduino IDE (set to 9600 baud).
   - Observe the Serial Monitor for messages indicating the presence or absence of a magnetic field.

#### Applications

- **Proximity Detection:** Use in projects requiring proximity sensing based on magnetic field presence.
- **Security Systems:** Integrate into security systems to detect unauthorized opening of doors or cabinets.
- **Automation:** Implement in automation projects to trigger actions based on magnetic field detection.

#### Notes

- Ensure the Hall Effect sensor is positioned correctly relative to the magnetic field source for accurate detection.
- Adjust the delay time in the `loop()` function to control the frequency of sensor readings based on your project requirements.
- Consider using additional components like magnets or magnetic materials to test and calibrate the sensor's sensitivity.
